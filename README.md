This repo exists as a learning exercise and as means to create a reasonably
functional clojurescript wrapper around PIXI.js to use for other projects.
While I shall be, somewhat losely, following the examples at
https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#renderer I do not intend an
exact one-to-one mapping of functionality where doing so does not serve my main
purpose of being able to use clojursecript to write functional logic for webGL
games.

Further to this I indend this repo to be a functioning example of building a
clojurescript web app using travis to host using gh-pages.
